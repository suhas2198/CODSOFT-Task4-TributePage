              Neerja Bhanot (7 September 1963 - 5 September 1986) was an Indian
              flight purser.
            </li>
            <li>
              On 5 September 1986, she saved a large number of passengers
              onboard Pan Am Flight 73, which had been hijacked by four
              Palestinian terrorists from the Abu Nidal Organization after it
              made a stopover at Jinnah International Airport in Pakistan.
            </li>
            <li>
              The terrorists held the cabin crew at gunpoint and ordered them to
              collect passports of the passengers. Knowing they’d shoot the
              Americans among them, Neerja swiftly hid their passports, even
              disposed some off the rubbish chute. There were 41 Americans on
              board, only two died.
            </li>
            <li>
              Neerja Bhanot put aside all fears and took charge. She used her
              presence of mind to get to the emergency exit. No, she didn’t
              flee. She couldn’t. She was a patriot, she couldn’t see innocent
              men, women and children bleed at the hands of these terrorists.
              She opened the emergency exit and helped the passengers evacuate
              the aircraft.
            </li>
            <li>
              She was shot to death while protecting three children. She took a
              bullet to protect other people. She died fighting terrorism. She
              gave up her life shielding humanity. She lived a brave life, and
              died a hero. Twenty people died in that hijack. Neerja died so
              that 360 others could live.
            </li>
            <li>
              For her bravery, the Government of India posthumously awarded
              Bhanot the <b>Ashoka Chakra Award</b>, India's highest gallantry
              award for bravery in the face of the enemy during peacetime.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2004 the Indian Postal Service released a stamp commemorating
              her.
